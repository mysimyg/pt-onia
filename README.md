## What's a 9/80 schedule?

You work 9-hour days Monday through Thursday. Fridays alternate: one week you work 8 hours, the next week you're off. That off-Friday is your "9/80 Friday."

Taking a Monday-Thursday off costs 9 hours of PTO. A working Friday costs 8 hours. Personal days always count as 1 day.
